# [921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-09)

[Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/submissions/1417443117?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-09)

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string,
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

You are given a parentheses string `s`. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

- For example, if `s = "()))"`, you can insert an opening parenthesis to be `"(**(** )))"` or a closing parenthesis to be `"())**)** )"`.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make `s` valid.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'('` or `')'`.

```python
class Solution:
    def minAddToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> int:
        opened = closed = unopened = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == "(":
                opened += 1
            else:
                if closed < opened:
                    closed += 1
                else:
                    unopened += 1
        return unopened + opened - closed
```
